### What exactly is BobaBot?
This is BobaBot, my 1A mechatronics design project in collaboration with Ethan Ahn, Karthigan Uthayan, and Yuming He. 

BobaBot streamlines the task of delivering drinks by eliminating the need for a waiter or deliveryman. It retrieves the drink ordered by the customer and transports it to the designated table. After the customer pays using a color-coded card, the robot hands over the drink and returns to its starting point, successfully completing its task.


### Features
All information on the project can be found in the [Report](https://github.com/joeymaillette04/BobaBot/blob/main/Final%20Report%20(1).pdf) and some of the  interesting topics that can be found:
* Mechanical Design
* Path Finding and Navigation
* Trigonometric Acceleration
* PID control (Gyro)

...  and the list continues!

### Technology Stack
BobaBot was created using the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms kit, and was programmed using ROBOTC, a text-based programming language specific to EV3 that is based of off C. Too view in-depth code view the [main.c file](https://github.com/joeymaillette04/BobaBot/blob/main/main.c).
